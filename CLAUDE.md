# Project Instructions

1. Commit after every change.

2. After completing each task, append to progress.txt:
   - Task completed and PRD item reference
   - Key decisions made and reasoning
   - Files changed
   - Any blockers or notes for next iteration
   Keep entries concise. Sacrifice grammar for concision. This file helps future iterations skip exploration.

3. PRD items are in prd-items.json. Update `passes: true` when verified.
