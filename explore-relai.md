# Exploring RelAI as Bazaar Alternative

## Next Steps

1. **Visit RelAI marketplace**: https://relai.fi/market
   - Browse available Solana APIs
   - Check if more trading/DeFi endpoints than Bazaar

2. **Check for API documentation**:
   - https://relai.fi/documentation
   - Look for discovery API or endpoint list export

3. **Contact RelAI**:
   - Ask if they have programmatic discovery API
   - Request Solana endpoint catalog

4. **Fallback**: Manually curate x402.json endpoints
   - List 10-20 known providers
   - Fetch manifests directly
   - Build custom registry

## Questions to Answer

- Does RelAI have more Solana endpoints than Bazaar's 12?
- Is there a public API to query their marketplace?
- Do they support the same x402 v2 protocol?
